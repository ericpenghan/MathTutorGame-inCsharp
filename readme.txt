Personal Project:
1.This program is designed like a game with 2 levels. It's for kids who wants to learn math. There are 4 tutorials with questions they can do, each tutorial has two levels; They can only get to the next level if they score 80 points. It will start by welcome the user to the program and display and menu, and the user has to enter one of the valid number choices. Each choices led to different tutorial, and once they complete one, the menu will pop back and ask the user choose another tutorial or they will always have the option to quit the program. 
2.This program uses and call many different class and call many different function in switch statement. Also for the class, some of them are inheritance and modify in their sub classes!
